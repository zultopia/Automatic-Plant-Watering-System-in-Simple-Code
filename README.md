# Automatic-Plant-Watering-System-in-Simple-Code

This repository contains a project undertaken by me, Marzuli Suhada M (13522070), to fulfill the assignment for the IF2120 Discrete Mathematics paper in 2023. The source code consists of one stage: determining whether the automatic plant watering system is on or off based on the current conditions.

## Determining Factors

The system's operation is influenced by three factors:

1. <span style="color: #FF5733">**Switch On/Off**</span>
   - The variable `x` mirrors the manual switch's functionality. If `x` is active (1), the system is in an ON state, and the watering mechanism is engaged. If `x` is inactive (0), the system is in an OFF state, and the watering process is halted.

2. <span style="color: #33FF4E">**Interval Time Setting**</span>
   - The variable `y` represents an adjustable interval time setting. An active state (1) for `y` indicates that the system is within the specified time interval, allowing for flexible watering schedules. When `y` is inactive (0), the system responds to soil conditions immediately.

3. <span style="color: #339FFF">**Soil Moisture Sensing**</span>
   - The variable `z` reflects the conditions of soil moisture in a binary state: 1 (ON) for moist soil and 0 (OFF) for dry soil.

## Boolean Algebra Function

The final result is determined using the Boolean algebra function derived from minimization:
\[ f(x, y, z) = x + yz' \]

If the output is <span style="color: #33FF4E; font-weight: bold">1</span>, the automatic plant watering system will be ON, and the plants will be watered. Conversely, if the output is <span style="color: #FF5733; font-weight: bold">0</span>, the automatic plant watering system will be in a dormant state.

## How to Use

1. Input the current conditions:
   - Switch state (ON/OFF)
   - Interval time (in days)
   - Soil moisture height (in cm)

2. Run the program to check whether the automatic plant watering system is ON or OFF based on the given conditions.
